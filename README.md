# ProjectOne

In the next two months I want to build a software that... 

allows me to organize the pictures and documents I create on my iPad into one file structure that is easily exportable into something like gMail or google drive. Or I want to create a mobile version for the card game I am currently working on. I want to have both a PC and mobile. The general concept will have similar online functionality to games like Hearthstone. The overall mechanics of the game are different however.
